		This webpage will take you to a learning ride to create India’s most loved snack Samosa.
Hello friends, my name is Dr. Proton and I’m your friend and guide for this tour. Samosa is a popular
snack in India. Everyone, from a child to a grandma, loves this spicy fried dish. The eating procedure
is simple: bite a piece and savour it. As you know the famous quote—
<blockquote><center>“Better belly burst than good food lost”</center></blockquote>
<cite><center>---Navjot Singh Sidhu</center></cite>

	The quote is word-by-word applicable to every Indian. We Indians don’t give a crap to what is good
or bad to our health. We just go eating and eating.
The recipe is quite simple. Take fine flour (Maida), knead it well and stuff it with Indian spices mixed
meshed potato. Try to give it the shape of a solid triangular snack. If you keep it flat and disc shaped,
it would rather be called as ‘Kachori’.

Unemployment in India is a big problem. Samosa is a dish that you can master at and can open you
own outlet to run a business. Keep innovating your recipe, and you will be in samosa business. Even
PM of India mentioned cooking and selling a brother snack of samosa called ‘Pakora’ to remove the
menace of unemployment from our country.
